## Model Training üöÄ
- ### First iteration
    - [Data-pipeline](/assets/Datasetspecification_v1.md)
    - #### Model Hyperparameters
        - **Batch Size:** 8
        - **Optimizer:** SGD
        - **Loss Function:** Cross Entropy 
        - **Iterations:** 40

    - ##### Model Evaluation
        - **Validation Accuracy:** 95%
        - **Validation Training Curve:** ![Validation Training Curve](assets/Images/May-08_14-52-58/validation_loss.png)
        - **Validation Accuracy Curve:** ![Validation Accuracy Curve](assets/Images/May-08_14-52-58/validation_curve.png)
        - **Confusion Matrix:**  ![Confusion Matrix](assets/Images/May-08_14-52-58/Screenshot%202024-05-09%20091641.png)
    ## Analysis:
      While the validation accuracy appears satisfactory, it was influenced by aggressive augmentation techniques, such as significantly increasing brightness, resulting in some images becoming entirely black or white. This had a detrimental effect on the model's accuracy. Analyzing Grad-CAM demonstrated that the model was indeed focusing on the correct areas for classification.

      This Grad-CAM demonstration showcases the model's ability to handle augmentation, directing its attention primarily towards relevant documents while largely disregarding the background.

        - **Batch Size:** 16
        - **Optimizer:** SGD
        - **Loss Function:** Cross Entropy 
        - **Iterations:** 40

    - ##### Model Evaluation
        - **Validation Accuracy:** 98%
        - **Validation Training Curve:** ![Validation Training Curve](assets/Images/May-10_14-43-13/valid_Loss.png)
        - **Validation Accuracy Curve:** ![Validation Accuracy Curve](assets/Images/May-10_14-43-13/valid_accuracy.png)
        - **Confusion Matrix:**  ![Confusion Matrix](assets/Images/May-10_14-43-13/confusion.png)
    ## Analysis:
      Fixing augmentaion pipeline the model was able to gain additional accuracy points.
