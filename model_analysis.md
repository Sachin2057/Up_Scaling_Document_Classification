- ### First iteration
    - [Data-pipeline](/assets/Datasetspecification_v1.md)
    - #### Model Hyperparameters
        - **Batch Size:** 8
        - **Optimizer:** SGD
        - **Loss Function:** Cross Entropy 
        - **Iterations:** 40

    - ##### Model Evaluation
        - **Validation Accuracy:** 95%
        - **Validation Training Curve:** ![Validation Training Curve](assets/Images/May-08_14-52-58/validation_loss.png)
        - **Validation Accuracy Curve:** ![Validation Accuracy Curve](assets/Images/May-08_14-52-58/validation_curve.png)
        - **Confusion Matrix:**  ![Confusion Matrix](assets/Images/May-08_14-52-58/Screenshot%202024-05-09%20091641.png)
    ## Analysis:
    While the validation accuracy appears satisfactory, it was influenced by aggressive augmentation techniques, such as significantly increasing brightness, resulting in some images becoming entirely black or white. This had a detrimental effect on the model's accuracy. Analyzing Grad-CAM demonstrated that the model was indeed focusing on the correct areas for classification.

    This Grad-CAM demonstration showcases the model's ability to handle augmentation, directing its attention primarily towards relevant documents while largely disregarding the background.

- ### Third iteration
    - [Data-pipeline](/assets/Datasetspecification_v1.md)
    - #### Model Hyperparameters
        - **Batch Size:** 8
        - **Optimizer:** SGD
        - **Loss Function:** Cross Entropy 
        - **Iterations:** 40

    - ##### Model Evaluation
        - **Validation Accuracy:** 86.25%
        - **Validation Training Curve:** ![Validation Training Curve](assets/Images/May-15_05-29-24/valiadtion%20loss.png)
        - **Validation Accuracy Curve:** ![Validation Accuracy Curve](assets/Images/May-15_05-29-24/Valiadtion%20accuracy%20curve.png)
        - **Confusion Matrix:**  ![Confusion Matrix](assets/Images/May-15_05-29-24/confusion%20matrix.png)
    ## Analysis:
        The low attribute of this model is due to the amount of data in in the other categories initial only 16 images were added without augmentation which has skewed the model predection and inference this problem is solved in later itteration by adding more data.
     
- ### Fourth itteration
    - [Data-pipeline](/assets/Datasetspecification_v1.md)
    - #### Model Hyperparameters
        - **Batch Size:** 8
        - **Optimizer:** SGD
        - **Loss Function:** Cross Entropy 
        - **Iterations:** 40

    - ##### Model Evaluation
        - **Validation Accuracy:** 86.25%
        - **Validation Training Curve:** ![Validation Training Curve](assets/Images/May-15_05-29-24/valiadtion%20loss.png)
        - **Validation Accuracy Curve:** ![Validation Accuracy Curve](assets/Images/May-15_05-29-24/Valiadtion%20accuracy%20curve.png)
        - **Confusion Matrix:**  ![Confusion Matrix](assets/Images/May-15_05-29-24/confusion%20matrix.png)
    ## Analysis:
        The low performance of this model is due to the limited amount of data in other categories. Initially, only 16 images were added without augmentation, which skewed the model's predictions and inferences. This problem is addressed in later iterations by adding more data.

   The model's poor performance is likely due to limited training data and an excessive number of parameters, causing it to overfit. Overfitting happens when the model learns the training data too well, capturing noise rather than general patterns, leading to poor generalization on new data. To improve, one could increase the training data or reduce the model's complexity through parameter reduction or regularization techniques. Balancing model complexity with adequate data is essential for better performance.
